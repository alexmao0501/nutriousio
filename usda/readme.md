# USDA readme

- Use `retrieve_from_usda.py` for grabbing food from USDA.
- `retrieve_from_mongo.py` is a legacy function for searching food from mongoDB. It's currently deleted, but if anyone wants to search in mongodb, there are past versions that have this file available, and can provide a reference.
- All others are peripherals/helper functions.
